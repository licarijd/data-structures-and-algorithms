Linear Search


In Computer Science, Linear Search (or sequential search) is a method
of finding a target value within a list.

It sequentially checks each element of the array for the target value 
until it is found.

In the best case scenario, the target is the first element of the list,
and the Time Complexity is O(1).

In the worst case scenario, the target is the last item in the list
(or not in the list), and the Time Complexity is O(n).


JavaScript Implementations of Linear Search for Arrays:

- indexOf()

- findIndex()

- find()

- includes()


Linear Search is ok, but not the best. We can't use it for things like 
indexing websites, like Google, or finding friends on Facebook. It's going 
to cost a lot of time.

This can be improved if our array is sorted. See ../Binary Search
