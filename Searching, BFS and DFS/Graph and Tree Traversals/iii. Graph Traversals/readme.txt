Graph Traversals


What we've just learned about BFS and DFS for Tree traversal also 
applies to Graphs.

This is because Trees are simply a type of Graph.

So, apart from using 'left' and 'right' properties (perhaps there's 
10 children), we can do the same thing using BFS and DFS.

This is very useful since Graphs are used to model real life things, like 
a recommendations engine at Amazon.

We can see what types of items 
are related (or which items are most related to the last book we 
purchased); in this case, we'd use BFS.

Or, for friend recommendation networks on Facebook or LinkedIn.
DFS might be used to figure out what degree of connection you have 
with someone.

This is the basis of how Peer-to-Peer networks work; and how things like 
Google Maps works.
