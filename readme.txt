A data structure is a collection of values, and algorithms are the steps
or processes we put into place to manipulate these collections of values.

Algorithms involve using data structures to create programs.


Good Code is:

Readable

Scalable:

- Speed (number of operations, Big-O time complexity)

- Memory (Big-O space complexity)

Speed is usually dictated by CPU, and Memory is usually dictated by how much
RAM the computer has.

In most programming solutions, there's a tradeoff between space and memory.
So if you want things to go faster, you may need more memory. And vice-versa.


** To easily run JS code, use repl.it: https://repl.it/@licarijd/LoneExtraneousTrialsoftware

** Blockchain is a very popular data structure these days. 
It has some aspects of Linked Lists, it has does some hashing,
and it also uses some Trie data structures, and Trees.
