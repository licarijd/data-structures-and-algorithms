Arrays

- sometimes called lists

- organizes items sequentially (one after another) in memory

- simplest and most used data structures

- since data in arrays are stored in order, they have the smallest footprint
of any data structure

- so if all you need to do is store some data and iterate over it, then arrays
are the best choice (especially if you know the indices of items you're storing,
since arrays have lookup time of O(1))


Operations and time Complexity

Lookup - O(1)

Push - O(1)

Insert - O(n)

Delete - O(n)


** Operations on strings are the same! Strings are simply arrays of characters.
