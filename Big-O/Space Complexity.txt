When a program executes, it has two ways to remember things:

The Heap, and the Stack.

The heap is usually where we store variables that we assign values to and the
stack is usually where we keep track of our function calls.

Sometimes we want to optimize for using less memory instead of using less time.

Talking about memory (space complexity) is very similar to talking about time cost.
We simply look at the total size relative to the size of the input and see how
many variables (how much memory) we're allocating.


Causes of Space Complexity 

- Variables 

- Data Structures

- Function Calls 

- Allocations
