// What is the time complexity of using '.length'?

'sdfsdfsdfsdf'.length 

// Answer: it depends on how the language has implemented the length function.

// In JavaScript, 'length' is a preoperty of strings, not
// a function. So, it's O(1) time.

// In other languages, it may be a funtion that counts
// every item, resulting in O(n) time.
