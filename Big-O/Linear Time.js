// O(n) - Linear Time

// - the number of operations the computer has to perform is the same as the 
// number of the elements

// - so, the number of operations and the number of elements have a linear relationship

// Example

for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] === 'nemo') {
        console.log("NEMO")
    }
}
