Dynamic Programming


Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique using caching. If you have something you can cache, you can use Dynamic Programming.

At a high level, dynamic programming is a way of solving problems by breaking it down into a collection of subproblems, 
solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions in case next time the same subproblem occurs.
