Dynamic Programming


Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique using caching. If you have something you can cache, you can use Dynamic Programming.

At a high level, dynamic programming is a way of solving problems by breaking it down into a collection of subproblems, 
solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions in case next time the same subproblem occurs.


Fibbonacci - see https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/learn/lecture/12409072#overview
for an example of how the Fibonnacci problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming!

Dynamic Programming Summary

Dynamic Programming combines 2 concepts:

1) Divide and Conquer (recursion, like in Fibonacci)

2) Memoization


Here are some steps you can take to tell if Dynamic Programming might be beneficial:

1) Can the problem be divided into subproblems?

- is it a treelike structure where a problem can be divided up? 

- if so, it could indicate a recursive solution

2) Recursive Solution 

3) Are there repetetive subproblems?

- if so, they can be momoized

4) Memoized Subproblems
