Searching and Traversal Introduction

** Start with Linear Search, and revist this after all sub sections.


Closing Notes on Arrays 


If an array is sorted, we can arrange it in a Tree-like 
structure and use Divide and Conquer (Binary Search), to achieve O(log n)
Time Complexity. ** Many times, this is faster than doing a Linear Search
over and over!

If an array isn't sorted, and sorting won't make searching faster, use 
Linear Search.

If the array is a string, see if a Trie data structure would help.
