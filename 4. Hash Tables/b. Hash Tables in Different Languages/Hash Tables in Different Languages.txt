Hash Tables are implemented differently in different languages.

But most of the time, the key and the value can be any type of data structure.

For example, in JavaScript, we can have functions and objects as values (and we 
can also have functions as keys). But keys that are anything other than strings, 
like functions and numbers, get stringified in JavaScript.

However, in ES6, we have Maps and Sets (similar to other languages).


Maps and Sets

In JavaScript, the difference between a Map and an object is that Maps allow you 
to store any data type as the key (like arrays or functions). And, Maps maintain 
insertion order (objects are unordered). This can be helpful when iterating through 
Maps.

Sets are similar to Maps, except it only stores the keys, no values.


Each language comes with it's own pre-built versions of data structures. But 
at the end of the day, they're all hash tables.
